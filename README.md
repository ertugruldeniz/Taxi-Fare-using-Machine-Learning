Dataset Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

We'll train a machine learning model to predict the fare and duratian for a taxi ride in New York city given information like pickup date & time, pickup location, drop location and no. of passengers.
